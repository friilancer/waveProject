# Wave Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts. This project is [live](https://waveportal-starter-project.aniedietukudo.repl.co/)
